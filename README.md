# Google Data Analytics Certificate: Capstone Project
##Cyclist Ride Share Analysis


### INTRODUCTION
This case study in the capstone project that I chose to complete my Google Data Analytics certificate. Throughout this project, I will be analyzing historical data from a fictional bike sharing company, "Cyclistic", to assist in making recommendations for an upcoming marketing camapign. Although Cyclistic and the given scenarios are fabricated, this capstone project does involve real data that has been collected from August 2021 - July 2022 through a bike share program located in Chicago. I will be using the Google Big Query SQL IDE to data cleaning and analysis followed by Tableau for data visualization.
