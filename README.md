# Google Data Analytics Certificate: Capstone Project
## Cyclist Ride Share Analysis


### INTRODUCTION
This case study in the capstone project that I chose to complete my Google Data Analytics certificate. Throughout this project, I will be analyzing historical data from a fictional bike sharing company, "Cyclistic", to assist in making recommendations for an upcoming marketing camapign. Although Cyclistic and the given scenarios are fabricated, this capstone project does involve real data that has been collected from August 2021 - July 2022 through a bike share program located in Chicago. I will be using the Google Big Query SQL IDE to data cleaning and analysis followed by Tableau for data visualization.

### SCENARIO
Cyclistic is a fictional bike sharing company located in Chicago. It operates a fleet of more than 5,800 bicycles which can be accessed from over 600 docking stations across the city. Bikes can be borrowed from one docking station, ridden, then returned to any docking station in the system Over the years marketing campaigns have been broad and targeted a cross-section of potential users. Data analysis has shown that riders with an annual membership are more profitable than casual riders. The marketing team are interested in creating a campaign to encourage casual riders to convert to members.

The companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships and needs to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

### BUSINESS TASK
- How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
- Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
- How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

### DATA PREPARATION
#### DATA SOURCE AND CREDIBILITY?
The [databases](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) that were used for the purpose of the ride share analysis were obtained Motivate, a company that is employed by the City of Chicago to collect data on the bike share operation throughout the city. 

#### DATA ORGANIZATION
The data was downloaded as separate CSV files, that were then joined together using SQL to make a new, combined annual database of the previous years worth  of bicycle usage data. The original files contained 13 columns with important information which include ride ID, ride time, start/end locations, etc.

NOTE: The original 12 (monthly) CSV files

### PROCESS AND CLEANING
